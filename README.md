# 01-HTML-CSS-Git-Code-Refactor

## Description 

Following the requests of the User (marketing agency), the codebase was adjusted so that it follows accessibility standards & site was optimized for search engines.

The source code was reviewed and updated with semantic HTML elements where needed. Appropriate elements were used for styling and positioning of the content. The title was updated to be more descriptive, and heading attributes reviewed for order. Images were made more accessible by adding alt attributes. Bootstrap was also implemented, and practice using comments was applied!

Some of the aspects which were trickier to accomplish were the resizing of images and text on smaller devices.
